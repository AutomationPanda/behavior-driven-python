Feature: DuckDuckGo Web Browsing
  As a web surfer,
  I want to find information online,
  So I can learn new things and get tasks done.

  # Web scenarios can be highly declarative, which focuses on behavior.
  # Don't get caught up in button names and layouts at the Gherkin level.
  # Note that these scenarios use Selenium WebDriver to do browser interactions.

  Scenario: Basic DuckDuckGo Search
    Given the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed
    When the user searches for "panda"
    Then results are shown for "panda"
